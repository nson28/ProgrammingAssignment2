## This program will create a  matrix stored in a cache and creates an inverse for the  
## matrix created

## this function will create a cache matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function will create an inverse of the matrix created 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
